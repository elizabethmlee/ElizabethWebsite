        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration. I plan on concentrating in Accounting, Finance, or Information Systems by my third year. So far, my time at UCR has become a place of self-reflection and self-growth. I noticed that I have grown to be more independent and responsible. On campus, I am involved in the Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) and the Accounting Society. The VSA's goal is to educate our campus on Vietnamese culture and to embrace diversity. In the Accounting Society's mission is to help connect UCR Accounting students with the resources they need to become successful. We also provide help for individuals that need help with filling out their income taxes through the VITA program, or Volunteer Income Tax Assistance. While I do attend school in Riverside, I grew up in Los Angeles County and am actively looking for a job there.<br><br>

         Over the summer of 2019, I have had the privilege of interning at an accounting firm based in Rosemead, California. At this firm, I became more knowledgeable about accounting applications such as QuickBooks as well as maintaining professionalism in the workplace. The summer internship was an enlightening experience because I was able to educate and enrich myself with information and knowledge not commonly taught in a classroom setting. Furthermore, I have done administrative work for the Monterey Park Hospital in Monterey Park, California and the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens. These institutions have allowed to me to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of customer/client relations. <br><br>

        In high school, I was involved in Math Club, National Honors Society (NHS), California Scholarship Federation (CSF), and Academic Decathlon. I was the Secretary of Math Club and the Vice President of Academic Decathlon. These work-intensive positions pushed me to become more organized and accountable for the actions that I make. I learned to manage my time better as I balanced school, my club positions, and Academic Decathlon (an academic competition). My years of service in NHS and CSF emphasized the importance of community service to me and how we can all work to provide for our community. The community events that I attended broadened my perspective on the world around me. I also hosted our school's annual Math Field Day event for middle school students. The event was designed to encourage middle schoolers' love and passion for math, as well as prepare them for high school level mathematics. All of these combined allowed me to understand the importance of teamwork as well as grow the leader in me.
